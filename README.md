# Ibexa Commerce PoC "Power of context"

The repository contains all the code snippets included in https://speakerdeck.com/konradoboza/ibexa-global-partner-conference-2024.

The main objective is to present ways to attach remote PIM to Ibexa DXP 4.6 and customize Ibexa packages:
- storefront
- cart
- checkout
- order-management

for storing contextual data added to the purchasable products.

Please keep in mind that this repository contains all the code needed for the demo presented during Ibexa Global Partner Conference 2024. It's not installable per se, but all the namespaces and code placement are enough to use within your own Ibexa DXP-based project "as-is".
